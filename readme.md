# UX
 
* As an everyday visitor I want to experience User Friendly platforms that are easy to understand.
* The visitor is the individual who wants to find out more information about Rasmus Hammarberg. The resume page helps them do just that. 
* They will experience an ordinary, but different kind of resume page. With lots of animations and even API’s integrated on the platform.

# REASONS FOR DEVELOPMENT

#### I (Colin Hammarberg) am developing/building this resume and informational platform for my beloved brother (Rasmus Hammarberg). The goal with the site is to create a unique resume site, where professional information can be found about Rasmus Hammarberg. I'm putting a lot of focus on the design, and also to implement functions, to create an extrodinary visual effect and interaction with the user. I will also be implementing an API (most probably a Google Map JavaScript API) and include Javascript for each and every page.

# FEATURES

### All of the pages have been created with a mix of HTML, CSS, Javascript & jQuery. This is shown very clearly, especially on the landing page where a lot of things are happening with the jQuery functions. 

* The <b>landing</b> page is the introduction of the website. The landing page gives the opportunity to the user to continue onto the visualisation of the Resume page (which is the main focus and goal for the site). The landing page is filled with different functions (jQuery & TweenMax as an example), to give the user a great first impression. The landing page also has many delayed functions, to make sure that the user enjoys every single bit of the website.
* The <b>resume</b> page gives the user a lot of visual effects and functions. These fucntions and effects have been implemented to get the user to enjoy reading the "important" information. 
* The <b>contact</b> page gives the user a possibility to contact Rasmus Hammarberg via the email form, which is currently connected to Emailjs. It also gives the user the visual enjoyment at its finest, according to myself at least. 
* The <b>gallery</b> page offers a nice image gallery (created with HTML, CSS, JavaScript & jQuery). It gives the user the possibility to visualize beatiful images provided by Rasmus Hammarberg. (Note that the gallery is currently made with images fetched from Pexels (free images))
* The site also offers an Google Map JavaScript API, which shows the user where Rasmus Hammarberg's office is located. The API feature is located below the <b>contact</b> form (on the contact page).

# CONTENT & IMAGES

#### The most of my images that I have used so far are from Pexels. Down below you'll find the links for those images. Please note that the reason for why Pexels images are integrated is because of that my Brother does not want to put his own images online at this point.

# TECHNOLOGIES USED 
 
### HTML
* The project uses HTML to get the content visual. The developer has been using HTML in all visual pages.
 
### CSS
* The project uses CSS to design all pages. I have put a lot of energy on the design and still am. I prefer to use external CSS, instead of internal CSS to achive a "better" code.

### Javascript
* The project uses Javascript. I have had minor difficulties with Javascript, but I think that so far it have turned our pretty well.

### jQuery 
* The project uses jQuery. I have added quite a lot of jQuery (but mostly the same code on all pages to receive an even functionality). 

### GSAP (Robust JavaScript Toolset, used for animations)
 
### FRAMEWORK
* I have also been using Bootstrap 4, to achive a very well functioning framework and responsiveness. 
 
### LANGUAGES
* The project uses English as its standard language and an Lang=”en” attribute has also been implemented.

# ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

1. While I'm working on this project, I receive a lot of tutoring from my close friend and now even colleague, Erik Wibom. Erik is a talented Software Engineer. When I'm stuck at some point in my projects, he tutors me and gives me a better understanding. 
2. For the past few months I have been learning a lot from both Code Institute, but also from individual tutoring lessons and Youtube Tutorials which I believe is a real benefit. I have received a better understanding with CSS animations along side with many other things from watching and coding alongside Youtube tutorials. I'm very grateful for all of the resources that I can take usage of in my journey of becomming a full stack software developer. 
3. For my home page I received tutor lessons from Erik Wibom, and I'm actually really happy of how that page looks at this point. Thank you for the help Erik!
4. For my gallery page I have received help from (https://bootsnipp.com/snippets/aMGnk). A beatiful platform to receive ideas and important specific coding.
5. For my contact page I have connected the form to Email.js together with my sendEmail.js file. I have used my knowledge from code institute to accomplish this, combined with help from the code institute tutor support team, which was a big help. Thank you for helping me out John!
6. For my article section I have taken inspiration from (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuckVFM5_0Y) and I would like to express my gratitute to (Online Tutorials) for learning me how to create these kind of cool effects. 
7. I would like to express my gratitute to Erik Wibom for helping me and for spending countless hours teaching me on his free time. It really means a lot to me. So, thank you man!

# DEPLOYMENT

* The entire code has been written on GitPod and later on pushed to GitHub. I like pushing, or at least commiting my code very often. To make sure that no code is getting lost without my knowledge. 
* When I push my code to GitHub from GitPod I'm writing five different steps in my terminal. 
1. The first step that I always do is to save the code (by pressing "save all"). 
2. The second step that I always do is to run "git status". This gives me an overview of which files I have left to push and save to GitHub. 
3. The third step that I always do is to run "git add" and then followed by the file or folder that I would like to add. 
4. The fourth step that I always do is to run "git commit -m "Here I write a comment. So that my commits to GitHub are well documented along the way. That makes it a a lot easier to locate which commit I have been making when looking back at them".
5. The fifth and last step that I always run in my terminal is just a simple "git push". This takes all of the files that I have added and then afterwards commited and pushes them all to GitHub (where the files and all of the code will be stored in a proper way).

* I'm always very careful with how I'm commiting my changes to GitHub and I'm always very well organized in my comments (after my "git commit -m" command), due to that I think it's very important to document along the way while writing code for a new project (or an old project). Because it helps you to easier find your way back if you need to head back and check your code out. Then it's really good to have your code commited in a proper and organized way.

# TESTING

### I have been conducting the following tests on the developed website (Macbook Air M1 + External Screen). 

#### Landing Page (Macbook Air M1 + External Screen)
* The landing page has been tested in form of pressing all navigation bar selections, which should lead to the appointed pages (home), (resume), (contact), (gallery). 
* The landing page has also been tested in form of checking so that all functions are working smoothly. I have also checked my code very carefully, to make sure that it's accurate. 

#### Resume Page (Macbook Air M1 + External Screen)
* The resume page has also been tested in form of checking so that all of the functions are accurate according to what's actually happening on the screen when a user is interfacing with the website. All of the navigation bar selections have been tested, so as the footer selections and the buttons which lead to articles written by Rasmus Hammarberg. 

#### Contact Page (Macbook Air M1 + External Screen)
* The contact page has had a different testing method. All of the ordinary features has been tested, but the contact page also contains a contact form, which features EmailJS. This feature has been tested by sending ten emails (from both ordinary email addresses, but also mailinator addresses), to make sure that all new contact requests are registered on my EmailJS server (with the accuarte Service ID & Email Template). 
* The contact page also features a Google Maps JavaScript Api which shows where Rasmus Hammarberg is actually located (in New York). 

#### Gallery Page (Macbook Air M1 + External Screen)
* The gallery page has been tested in form of pressing all navigation bar selections, which should lead to the appointed pages (home), (resume), (contact), (gallery). 
* The gallery page also features a beatiful and functioning responsive image gallery, where the user can scroll through images taken of Rasmus Hammarberg. This has been tested by hovering over (where it gets zoomed in) and by pressing any of the images. When pressing any of the images, the user gets to vusualize the images on a bigger screen and gets to scroll through the album in a beatiful and responsive way. (Plase note that currently the images in the gallery are free images linked from Pexels.com).

### Overall testing
* I have also tested the platform with connecting 10 devices at the same time. Just to make sure that nothing would crash. It worked fine. 
* I have also placed my URL in a code validator service to make sure that there are no issues with the general code.

### I have been conducting the following tests on the developed website (Ipad Pro Screen).

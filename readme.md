# RASMUS HAMMARBERG
 
### The RASMUS HAMMARBERG resume website was created for every single individual who wants to find out more information about Rasmus Hammarberg. The website is basic, but a different kind of resume and informational page.

# UX
 
* As an everyday visitor I want to experience User Friendly platforms that are easy to understand.
* The visitor is the individual who wants to find out more information about Rasmus Hammarberg. The resume page helps them do just that. 
* They will experience an ordinary, but different kind of resume page. With lots of animations and even API’s integrated on the platform. 

# REASONS FOR DEVELOPMENT

### I (Colin Hammarberg) am developing/building this resume and informational platform for my beloved brother (Rasmus Hammarberg). The goal with the site is to create a unique resume site, where professional information can be found about Rasmus Hammarberg. I'm putting a lot of focus on the design, and also to implement functions, to create an extrodinary visual effect and interaction with the user. I will also be implementing an API (most probably a Google Map JavaScript API) and include Javascript for each and every page.

# TECHNOLOGIES USED 
 
### HTML
* The project uses HTML to get the content visual. The developer has been using HTML in all visual pages.
 
### CSS
* The project uses CSS to design all pages. I have put a lot of energy on the design and still am. I prefer to use external CSS, instead of internal CSS to achive a "better" code.

### CSS ANIMATIONS
* The project uses CSS Animations to accomplish animated effects in specific areas where GSAP or jQuery is not used.

### JavaScript
* The project uses Javascript. I have had minor difficulties with Javascript, but I think that so far it have turned our pretty well.

### jQuery 
* The project uses jQuery. I have added quite a lot of jQuery (but mostly the same code on all pages to receive an even functionality). 

### GSAP
* The project uses GSAP to achieve animations for specific areas.
 
### FRAMEWORK
* I have also been using Bootstrap 4, to achive a very well functioning framework and responsiveness. 
 
### LANGUAGES
* The project uses English as its standard language and an Lang=”en” attribute has also been implemented.

# FEATURES

### All of the pages have been created with a mix of HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery and other family languages of JavaScript mentioned above. This is shown very clearly, especially on the landing page where a lot of things are happening with the jQuery functions. 

## Existing Features

### Navigation bar

<a href="" target="_blank"><img src="/documentation/Navigation-Bar.png" alt="Book Bites mobile Screen"></a>

- Featured on all four pages, the full responsive navigation bar includes links to the "Rasmus Hammarberg" logo, Home/Landing page, Resume page, Contact page and Gallery page. It is identical in each page to allow for smooth navigation throughout the whole website.
- This nav bar will allow the user to easily find him or herself all around the webiste. 

### Home page/Landing page 

<a href="" target="_blank"><img src="/documentation/Home-page-img.png" alt="Book Bites mobile Screen"></a>

- The landing page contains a couple of cool elements and effects. It contains a landing image, combined with some nice linked wordings.
- The landing page also contains a footer section in the bottom of the page. 

### Footer section 

<a href="" target="_blank"><img src="/documentation/Footer.png" alt="Book Bites mobile Screen"></a>

- The footer section is available on each and every page on the website. 
- It contains general information and options for the user. The user gets the opportunity to download the cv, locate Rasmus Hammarbergs email address and multiple links to different social media pages. 

### Resume page

- The Resume page contains a landing section, where there are delays on the nav bar to actually show up and the sentence "Welcome to my resume page. Enjoy." is written out, by using a typewriter effect. 
- The Resume page also contains a section of an "About me" text and three linked articles underneath. These articles are located at www.spce.com and are written by Rasmus Hammarberg. 

### Contact page

<a href="" target="_blank"><img src="/documentation/Contact-page.png" alt="Book Bites mobile Screen"></a>

- The Contact page has the exact same landing page and the same visual effect as the Resume page, but here the sentence "Welcome to my contact page. Enjoy." is written out instead. 
- When the user scrolls downwards, the user will be able to send a message/email through the contact form. The contact form is currently connected to Email.JS. 
- The page also contains a Google Map JavaScript API. Which gives the user the possibility to see where Rasmus Hammarberg's office is located. 

### Gallery page

<a href="" target="_blank"><img src="/documentation/Gallery-page-img.png" alt="Book Bites mobile Screen"></a>

- The Gallery page has the exact same landing page and the same visual effect as the Contact page, but here the sentence "Welcome to my gallery page. Enjoy." is written out instead. 
- When the user scrolls down, the user will have the opportunity to lock at multiple images (images are currently borrowed from Pexels) in a very beatiful image gallery.

### Download CV 

- If the user would like to download Rasmus Hammarberg's beatiful CV/Resume, then the user could do so by clicking on the "Download CV" options.

### Features left to implement

* In the future I would like to find a Linkedin API search motor (provided by Linkedin) for the user to have the option to make profile searches on Linkedin via the Rasmus Hammarberg platform.
* I would also like to integrate SPCE (which is the company that Rasmus Hammaarberg works for). Where the user could have the option to schedule an appointment or a demo by a meeting scheduling tool. Then the meeting would take place via SPCE (which is a digital B2B sales tool).
* I would also like to change my Email function and contact area. Now I have been using EmailJS, but would in the future be very possitive to use other features to accomplish a better email communication with the users. Due to that I think EmailJS is very simple and easy to use/accomplish, but it's difficult to accomplish an automatic response with your users (in form of automatic responses to the registered email address).

# TESTING

### I have been conducting the following tests on the developed website (Macbook Air M1 + External Screen). 

#### Landing Page (Macbook Air M1 + External Screen)
* The landing page has been tested in form of pressing all navigation bar selections, which should lead to the appointed pages (home), (resume), (contact), (gallery). 
* The landing page has also been tested in form of checking so that all functions are working smoothly. I have also checked my code very carefully, to make sure that it's accurate. 

#### Resume Page (Macbook Air M1 + External Screen)
* The resume page has also been tested in form of checking so that all of the functions are accurate according to what's actually happening on the screen when a user is interfacing with the website. All of the navigation bar selections have been tested, so as the footer selections and the buttons which lead to articles written by Rasmus Hammarberg. 

#### Contact Page (Macbook Air M1 + External Screen)
* The contact page has had a different testing method. All of the ordinary features has been tested, but the contact page also contains a contact form, which features EmailJS. This feature has been tested by sending ten emails (from both ordinary email addresses, but also mailinator addresses), to make sure that all new contact requests are registered on my integraded EmailJS server.
* The contact page also features a Google Maps JavaScript Api which shows where Rasmus Hammarberg is actually located (in New York). 

#### Gallery Page (Macbook Air M1 + External Screen)
* The gallery page has been tested in form of pressing all navigation bar selections, which should lead to the appointed pages (home), (resume), (contact), (gallery). 
* The gallery page also features a beatiful and functioning responsive image gallery, where the user can scroll through images taken of Rasmus Hammarberg. This has been tested by hovering over (where it gets zoomed in) and by pressing any of the images. When pressing any of the images, the user gets to vusualize the images on a bigger screen and gets to scroll through the album in a beatiful and responsive way. (Plase note that currently the images in the gallery are free images linked from Pexels.com).

#### Overall testing
* I have also tested the platform with connecting 10 devices at the same time. Just to make sure that nothing would crash. It worked fine. 

### I have been conducting the following tests on the developed website (Ipad Pro Screen).

#### Home/Landing Page (Ipad Screen)
* The landing page has been tested in form of pressing all navigation bar selections, which should lead to the appointed pages (home), (resume), (contact), (gallery). 
* The landing page has also been tested in form of checking so that all functions are working smoothly. I have also checked my code very carefully, to make sure that it's accurate. 

#### Resume Page (Ipad Screen)
* The resume page has also been tested in form of checking so that all of the functions are accurate according to what's actually happening on the screen when a user is interfacing with the website. All of the navigation bar selections have been tested, so as the footer selections and the buttons which lead to articles written by Rasmus Hammarberg. 

#### Contact Page (Ipad Screen)
* The contact page has had a different testing method. All of the ordinary features has been tested, but the contact page also contains a contact form, which features EmailJS. This feature has been tested by sending ten emails (from both ordinary email addresses, but also mailinator addresses), to make sure that all new contact requests are registered on my integraded EmailJS server. 
* The contact page also features a Google Maps JavaScript Api which shows where Rasmus Hammarberg is actually located (in New York). 

#### Gallery Page (Ipad Screen)
* The gallery page has been tested in form of pressing all navigation bar selections, which should lead to the appointed pages (home), (resume), (contact), (gallery). 
* The gallery page also features a beatiful and functioning responsive image gallery, where the user can scroll through images taken of Rasmus Hammarberg. This has been tested by hovering over (where it gets zoomed in) and by pressing any of the images. When pressing any of the images, the user gets to vusualize the images on a bigger screen and gets to scroll through the album in a beatiful and responsive way. The Ipad version's gallery scales down to fit an Ipad device nicely. (Plase note that currently the images in the gallery are free images linked from Pexels.com).

#### Overall testing
* I have also tested the platform with connecting 10 devices at the same time. Just to make sure that nothing would crash. It worked fine. 

#### Responsiveness (Ipad Screen)
* The webiste's responsiveness, framework and user-interface has also been tested on all pages using both the inspect selection through Google Chrome and on an actual Ipad Pro device.

### I have been conducting the following tests on the developed website (Mobile Screen).


#### Home/Landing Page (Mobile Screen)
* The landing page has been tested in form of pressing all navigation bar selections, which should lead to the appointed pages (home), (resume), (contact), (gallery). 
* The landing page has also been tested in form of checking so that all functions are working smoothly. I have also checked my code very carefully, to make sure that it's accurate.

#### Comment about testing period
* My experience with the testing procedure was good and I did not find any bugs that would keep the user to have a pleasant webpage experience. 

# CODE VALIDATOR
* The code has been run through validators, to make sure that the code is stable and accurate.
- HTML (https://validator.w3.org/)
- CSS (https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
- Please note that when I ran the HTML code through https://validator.w3.org/ it told me to change the dublicated menu id's. I have not changed it. The reason for this is that it works fine even though the dublicated menu id's and is not compromising the website in a bad way.

# UNFIXED BUGS 
* I have used dublicated menu id's to achieve my main menu and my rezise menu (for Ipad & Mobile usage). This will most probably be changed in the future, but currently it is not compromising the website in a bad way and therefor I have made the decision to not make any changes to it at this stage. 
* When I ran my CSS code through the https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/ it came some errors and warnings from the (https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.2.1/css/bootstrap.min.css) and (https://colinhammarberg.github.io/MS2/assets/css/animate.css). But, after speaking to the tutor team at Code Institute, they explained to me that errors coming from external script tags won't matter in the evaluation process. 

# DEPLOYMENT

* The site was deployed to GitHub pages. These are the steps that I followed to deploy my site:
- In the GitHub Repository, click on the settings option. 
- In the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch.
- When that has been done, save the selection. 
- Scroll down to where it says "Pages settings now has its own dedicated tab! Check it out here!" and click on it. 

The live link can be found here - (https://colinhammarberg.github.io/MS2/)

# PUSH TO GITHUB

* The entire code has been written on GitPod and later on pushed to GitHub. I like pushing, or at least commiting my code very often. To make sure that no code is getting lost without my knowledge. 
* When I push my code to GitHub from GitPod I'm writing five different steps in my terminal. 
1. The first step that I always do is to save the code (by pressing "save all"). 
2. The second step that I always do is to run "git status". This gives me an overview of which files I have left to push and save to GitHub. 
3. The third step that I always do is to run "git add" and then followed by the file or folder that I would like to add. 
4. The fourth step that I always do is to run "git commit -m "Here I write a comment. So that my commits to GitHub are well documented along the way. That makes it a a lot easier to locate which commit I have been making when looking back at them".
5. The fifth and last step that I always run in my terminal is just a simple "git push". This takes all of the files that I have added and then afterwards commited and pushes them all to GitHub (where the files and all of the code will be stored in a proper way).

* I'm always very careful with how I'm commiting my changes to GitHub and I'm always very well organized in my comments (after my "git commit -m" command), due to that I think it's very important to document along the way while writing code for a new project (or an old project). Because it helps you to easier find your way back if you need to head back and check your code out. Then it's really good to have your code commited in a proper and organized way.

* The second individual that I would like to thank is my Mentor Gurjot. Thank you for helping me along the way and giving me feedback on my projects. I'm super grateful! THANK YOU Gurjot!
* I have learned the typewriter effect from wathing and repeating after this youtube tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ciubFUYYuM) which has been a real benefit for me to get a better understanding of these effects and how to accomplish them.
* For my gallery page I have received help from (https://bootsnipp.com/snippets/aMGnk). A beatiful platform to receive ideas and important specific coding.
* For my article section I have taken inspiration from (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuckVFM5_0Y) and I would like to express my gratitute to (Online Tutorials) for learning me how to create these kind of cool effects.
* For my contact page I have connected the form to Email.js together with my sendEmail.js file. I have used my knowledge from code institute to accomplish this, combined with help from the code institute tutor support team, which was a big help. Thank you for helping me out John! 
* I made my menu a little bit different from my previous projects. This kind of menu (with a resize & close-btn function) was inspired by https://github.com/codegridweb and some tutoring lessons from Erik Wibom. I learned this kind of menu functions a couple of months ago, by building a personal project for fun and wanted to use the same kind of menu design in this project as well. So thank you CodeGrid for teaching me how to make different kinds of menu versions. Much appreciated. 

# ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

1. While I'm working on this project, I receive a lot of tutoring from my close friend and now even colleague, Erik Wibom. Erik is a talented Software Engineer. When I'm stuck at some point in my projects, he tutors me and gives me a better understanding. 
2. For the past few months I have been learning a lot from both Code Institute, but also from individual tutoring lessons and Youtube Tutorials which I believe is a real benefit. I have received a better understanding with CSS animations along side with many other things from watching and coding alongside Youtube tutorials. I'm very grateful for all of the resources that I can take usage of in my journey of becomming a full stack software developer. 
3. For my home page I received tutor lessons from Erik Wibom, and I'm actually really happy of how that page looks like at this point. Thank you for the help Erik!
4. I would like to express my gratitute to Erik Wibom for helping me and for spending countless hours teaching me on his free time. It really means a lot to me. So, thank you man!

To be able to head backwards and refreshen my memory with the EmailJS function, readme.md file structure and many more elements have been a real benefit for me along the way. So, thank you code institute. 

# CONTENT, IMAGES & MEDIA

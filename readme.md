# REASONS FOR DEVELOPMENT

##### I (Colin Hammarberg) am developing/building this resume platform for my beloved brother (Rasmus Hammarberg). The goal with the site is to create a unique resume site, where professional information can be found about Rasmus Hammarberg. I'm putting a lot of focus on the design, and also to implement functions, to create an extrodinary visual effect and interaction with the user. I will also be implementing an API (most probably a LinkedIn search motor API) and include Javascript for each and every page.

# FEATURES

### All of the pages have been created with a mix of HTML, CSS, Javascript & jQuery. This is shown very clearly, especially on the landing page where a lot of things are happening with the jQuery functions. 

* The <b>landing</b> page is the introduction of the website. The landing page gives the opportunity to the user to continue onto the visualisation of the Resume page (which is the main focus and goal for the site).
* The <b>resume</b> page gives the user a lot of visual effects and functions. These fucntions and effects have been implemented to get the user to enjoy reading the "important" information. 
* The <b>contact</b> page gives the user a possibility to contact Rasmus Hammarberg via the email form, which is currently connected to an auto-response (email support server). It also gives the user the visual enjoyment at its finest, according to myself at least. 
* The <b>gallery</b> page offers a nice image gallery (created with HTML, CSS & javascript). It gives the user the possibility to visualize beatiful images provided by Rasmus Hammarberg. (Note that the gallery is currently made with images fetched from Pexels (free images))

# TECHNOLOGIES USED 
 
### HTML
* The project uses HTML to get the content visual. The developer has been using HTML in all visual pages.
 
### CSS
* The project uses CSS to design all pages. I have put a lot of energy on the design and still am. I prefer to use external CSS, instead of internal CSS to achive a "better" code.

### Javascript
* The project uses Javascript. I have had minor difficulties with Javascript, but I think that so far it have turned our pretty well.

### jQuery 
* The project uses jQuery. I have added quite a lot of jQuery (but mostly the same code on all pages to receive an even functionality). 
 
### FRAMEWORK
* I have also been using Bootstrap 4, to achive a very well functioning framework and responsiveness. 
 
### LANGUAGES
* The project uses English as its standard language and an Lang=”en” attribute has also been implemented.

# ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

1. While I'm working on this project, I receive a lot of tutoring from my close friend and now even colleague, Erik Wibom. Erik is a talented Software Engineer. When I'm stuck at some point in my projects, he tutors me and gives me a better understanding. 
2. For the past few months I have been learning a lot from both Code Institute, but also from individual tutoring lessons and Youtube Tutorials which I believe is a real benefit. I have received a better understanding with CSS animations along side many other things from watching and coding alongside Youtube tutorials. I'm very grateful for all of the resources I can take usage of in my journey of becomming a software developer. 
3. For my home page I received tutor lessons from Erik Wibom, and I'm actually really happy of how that page looks at this point. Thank you for the help Erik!
4. For my gallery page I have received help from (https://bootsnipp.com/snippets/aMGnk). A beatiful platform to receive ideas and important specific coding.
5. For my contact page I have connected the form to Email.js together with my sendEmail.js file. I have used my knowledge from code institute to accomplish this, combined with help from the code institute totor support, which was a big help. Thank you for helping me out John!

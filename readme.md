2. [Beatiful Mock-Ups]()

##### I (Colin Hammarberg) am developing/building this resume platform for my beloved brother (Rasmus Hammarberg). The goal with the site is to create a unique resume site, where professional information can be found about Rasmus Hammarberg. I'm putting a lot of focus on the design, and also to implement functions, to create an extrodinary visual effect and interaction with the user. I will also be implementing an API (most probably a LinkedIn search motor API) and include Javascript for each and every page.

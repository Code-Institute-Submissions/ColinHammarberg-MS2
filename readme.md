# RASMUS HAMMARBERG
 
### The RASMUS HAMMARBERG resume website was created for every single individual who wants to find out more information about Rasmus Hammarberg. The website is basic, but a different kind of resume and informational page.

# UX
 
* As an everyday visitor I want to experience User Friendly platforms that are easy to understand.
* The visitor is the individual who wants to find out more information about Rasmus Hammarberg. The resume page helps them do just that. 
* They will experience an ordinary, but different kind of resume page. With lots of animations and even API’s integrated on the platform. 

# REASONS FOR DEVELOPMENT

### I (Colin Hammarberg) am developing/building this resume and informational platform for my beloved brother (Rasmus Hammarberg). The goal with the site is to create a unique resume site, where professional information can be found about Rasmus Hammarberg. I'm putting a lot of focus on the design, and also to implement functions, to create an extrodinary visual effect and interaction with the user. I will also be implementing an API (most probably a Google Map JavaScript API) and include Javascript for each and every page.

# TECHNOLOGIES USED 
 
### HTML
* The project uses HTML to get the content visual. The developer has been using HTML in all visual pages.
 
### CSS
* The project uses CSS to design all pages. I have put a lot of energy on the design and still am. I prefer to use external CSS, instead of internal CSS to achive a "better" code.

### CSS ANIMATIONS
* The project uses CSS Animations to accomplish animated effects in specific areas where GSAP or jQuery is not used.

### JavaScript
* The project uses Javascript. I have had minor difficulties with Javascript, but I think that so far it have turned our pretty well.

### jQuery 
* The project uses jQuery. I have added quite a lot of jQuery (but mostly the same code on all pages to receive an even functionality). 

### GSAP
* The project uses GSAP to achieve animations for specific areas.
 
### FRAMEWORK
* I have also been using Bootstrap 4, to achive a very well functioning framework and responsiveness. 
 
### LANGUAGES
* The project uses English as its standard language and an Lang=”en” attribute has also been implemented.

# FEATURES

### All of the pages have been created with a mix of HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery and other family languages of JavaScript mentioned above. This is shown very clearly, especially on the landing page where a lot of things are happening with the jQuery functions. 

## Existing Features

### Navigation bar

<img src="https://browser-blush-barnacle-p7ejyp38.ws-eu09.gitpod.io/workspace/MS2/documentation/Navigation-Bar.png">

- Featured on all four pages, the full responsive navigation bar includes links to the "Rasmus Hammarberg" logo, Home/Landing page, Resume page, Contact page and Gallery page. It is identical in each page to allow for smooth navigation throughout the whole website.
- This nav bar will allow the user to easily find him or herself all around the webiste. 

### Home page/Landing page 

<img src="https://browser-blush-barnacle-p7ejyp38.ws-eu09.gitpod.io/workspace/MS2/documentation/Landing-page-img.png">

- The landing page contains a couple of cool elements and effects. It contains a landing image, combined with some nice linked wordings.
- The landing page also contains a footer section in the bottom of the page. 

### Footer section 

<img src="https://browser-blush-barnacle-p7ejyp38.ws-eu09.gitpod.io/workspace/MS2/documentation/Footer.png">

- The footer section is available on each and every page on the website. 
- It contains general information and options for the user. The user gets the opportunity to download the cv, locate Rasmus Hammarbergs email address and multiple links to different social media pages. 

### Resume page

- The Resume page contains a landing section, where there are delays on the nav bar to actually show up and the sentence "Welcome to my resume page. Enjoy." is written out, by using a typewriter effect. 
- The Resume page also contains a section of an "About me" text and three linked articles underneath. These articles are located at www.spce.com and are written by Rasmus Hammarberg. 

### Contact page

<img src="https://browser-blush-barnacle-p7ejyp38.ws-eu09.gitpod.io/workspace/MS2/documentation/Contact-page.png">

- The Contact page has the exact same landing page and the same visual effect as the Resume page, but here the sentence "Welcome to my contact page. Enjoy." is written out instead. 
- When the user scrolls downwards, the user will be able to send a message/email through the contact form. The contact form is currently connected to Email.JS. 
- The page also contains a Google Map JavaScript API. Which gives the user the possibility to see where Rasmus Hammarberg's office is located. 

### Gallery page

<img src="https://browser-blush-barnacle-p7ejyp38.ws-eu09.gitpod.io/workspace/MS2/documentation/Gallery-page-img.png">

- The Gallery page has the exact same landing page and the same visual effect as the Contact page, but here the sentence "Welcome to my gallery page. Enjoy." is written out instead. 
- When the user scrolls down, the user will have the opportunity to lock at multiple images (images are currently borrowed from Pexels) in a very beatiful image gallery.

# TESTING

### I have been conducting the following tests on the developed website (Macbook Air M1 + External Screen). 

#### Landing Page (Macbook Air M1 + External Screen)
* The landing page has been tested in form of pressing all navigation bar selections, which should lead to the appointed pages (home), (resume), (contact), (gallery). 
* The landing page has also been tested in form of checking so that all functions are working smoothly. I have also checked my code very carefully, to make sure that it's accurate. 

#### Resume Page (Macbook Air M1 + External Screen)
* The resume page has also been tested in form of checking so that all of the functions are accurate according to what's actually happening on the screen when a user is interfacing with the website. All of the navigation bar selections have been tested, so as the footer selections and the buttons which lead to articles written by Rasmus Hammarberg. 

#### Contact Page (Macbook Air M1 + External Screen)
* The contact page has had a different testing method. All of the ordinary features has been tested, but the contact page also contains a contact form, which features EmailJS. This feature has been tested by sending ten emails (from both ordinary email addresses, but also mailinator addresses), to make sure that all new contact requests are registered on my integraded EmailJS server.
* The contact page also features a Google Maps JavaScript Api which shows where Rasmus Hammarberg is actually located (in New York). 

#### Gallery Page (Macbook Air M1 + External Screen)
* The gallery page has been tested in form of pressing all navigation bar selections, which should lead to the appointed pages (home), (resume), (contact), (gallery). 
* The gallery page also features a beatiful and functioning responsive image gallery, where the user can scroll through images taken of Rasmus Hammarberg. This has been tested by hovering over (where it gets zoomed in) and by pressing any of the images. When pressing any of the images, the user gets to vusualize the images on a bigger screen and gets to scroll through the album in a beatiful and responsive way. (Plase note that currently the images in the gallery are free images linked from Pexels.com).

#### Overall testing
* I have also tested the platform with connecting 10 devices at the same time. Just to make sure that nothing would crash. It worked fine. 

### I have been conducting the following tests on the developed website (Ipad Pro Screen).


#### Landing Page (Ipad Screen)
* The landing page has been tested in form of pressing all navigation bar selections, which should lead to the appointed pages (home), (resume), (contact), (gallery).

The Ipad version's gallery scales down to fit an Ipad device nicely. (Plase note that currently the images in the gallery are free images linked from Pexels.com).

#### Overall testing
* I have also tested the platform with connecting 10 devices at the same time. Just to make sure that nothing would crash. It worked fine. 

#### Responsiveness (Ipad Screen)
* The webiste's responsiveness, framework and user-interface has also been tested on all pages using both the inspect selection through Google Chrome and on an actual Ipad Pro device.

### I have been conducting the following tests on the developed website (Mobile Screen).

* The landing page has been tested in form of pressing all navigation bar selections, which should lead to the appointed pages (home), (resume), (contact), (gallery).

# CODE VALIDATOR
* The code has been run through validators, to make sure that the code is stable and accurate.
- HTML (https://validator.w3.org/)
- CSS (https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

# DEPLOYMENT

* The site was deployed to GitHub pages. These are the steps that I followed to deploy my site:
- In the GitHub Repository, click on the settings option. 
- In the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch.
- When that has been done, save the selection. 
- Scroll down to where it says "Pages settings now has its own dedicated tab! Check it out here!" and click on it.

# PUSH TO GITHUB

* The entire code has been written on GitPod and later on pushed to GitHub. I like pushing, or at least commiting my code very often. To make sure that no code is getting lost without my knowledge. 
* When I push my code to GitHub from GitPod I'm writing five different steps in my terminal. 
1. The first step that I always do is to save the code (by pressing "save all"). 
2. The second step that I always do is to run "git status". This gives me an overview of which files I have left to push and save to GitHub. 
3. The third step that I always do is to run "git add" and then followed by the file or folder that I would like to add. 
4. The fourth step that I always do is to run "git commit -m "Here I write a comment. So that my commits to GitHub are well documented along the way. That makes it a a lot easier to locate which commit I have been making when looking back at them".
5. The fifth and last step that I always run in my terminal is just a simple "git push". This takes all of the files that I have added and then afterwards commited and pushes them all to GitHub (where the files and all of the code will be stored in a proper way).

* I'm always very careful with how I'm commiting my changes to GitHub and I'm always very well organized in my comments (after my "git commit -m" command), due to that I think it's very important to document along the way while writing code for a new project (or an old project). Because it helps you to easier find your way back if you need to head back and check your code out. Then it's really good to have your code commited in a proper and organized way.

# CONTENT, IMAGES & MEDIA

#### The most of my images that I have used so far are from Pexels. Down below you'll find the links for those images. Please note that the reason for why Pexels images are integrated is because of that my Brother does not want to put his own images online at this point.
